# Induction Day - 3 Report
## Lecture 1 - by Dr. Jaswinder singh
The lecture given by Dr. Jaswinder singh was amazing. The students in the auditorium really seem to have enjoyed it and learned a lot from it. He presented his diverse views on God and science and how it is connected in various ways. He showed us a lot of Math tricks. Not only his knowledge of science, nature and God was insightful but his teachings were wise as well. But the most intriguing thing about him was his energy which was incomparable. He was also being humorous at certain points to help us relax. In summary, He did a splendid job and We learned a lot from him.

## Lecture 2 By Dr. Priya Darshni Madam
The second lecture was great as well, It was quite different from the first one and a different experience. She educated us with her knowledge on human values and step by step, she taught us about goals, values and purpose of life. The step by step process was different from the first lecture and we appreciated it. I really reflected on myself and the values she taught to us. Her step by step guide helped us to understand and make the concepts clear. At first, although it felt like she was quiet and slow but her lecture gradually build up and ended with a meaningful takeaway. I'm looking forwards to more of her lectures.

# Induction report day 4
It was an another day for me to learn different things. I attended two classes on 4th day, and though it was only introductory, I felt like I was begging a new journey. The induction programme was fine too as always.
## Dr. Priya Darshni Madam's lecture
Another great lecture as expected, It was even better than the previous one and I was once again fascinated by her ideas, though she start by recapping her previous lecture, she completely dwells into new concepts and insights futher expanding her ideas. It was an another great experience. I liked her most of the ideas, her takes on life and purpose of life. I was overall thrilled by the experience and would continue to work on the exercises given by her so I could improve myself and put her teachings to work.
## About the causmic club and other parts
This time I was presented with the top GNE club, its ideas and I liked it. The students wh o were likely the club members show the concept thinking and motive of the club. they showed how it improves teamwork and the club helps to develop various skills in the students. I was fascinated by it. the induction programme of the day concluded with some other lectures, like sir showing us how to buy the laptop which will be helpful to the students who would like to buy laptop, it also has one of the students performing a singing show with the guitar and I liked it, I always love how in GNE we always have fun activities along with studies.
